# Maloja

Simple self-hosted music scrobble database to create personal listening statistics. No recommendations, no social network, no nonsense.

## Why?

### Why not Last.fm?

Maloja is self-hosted. You will always be able to access your data, and not have to trust anyone to provide an API for it.

### Why not Libre.fm / GNU FM?

Maloja is meant to get rid of all the deadweight like a social network. It's just meant to keep track of your listening history and create statistics like your monthly charts.

### So just GNU FM, but with some stuff removed?

There is one 'added' feature: Maloja supports tracks with multiple artists. And since there is no global music database involved, it's much easier to have a consistent personal library - no more thirteen different spellings of the same group.

### Does it work?

No, it's in development. Just uploaded it here in case I die tomorrow. It can accept scrobbles and return some basic stats in JSON format so far.

### Why not use the established API?

Compatibility creates overhead effort. I only made this for myself, so I have no need to support lots of music players and scrobblers.
