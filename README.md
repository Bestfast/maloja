# Maloja

Simple self-hosted music scrobble database to create personal listening statistics. No recommendations, no social network, no nonsense.

## Never Asked Questions

### Why not Last.fm / Libre.fm?

Maloja is self-hosted. You will always be able to access your data, and not have to trust anyone to provide an API for it.

### Why not GNU FM?

Maloja gets rid of all the deadweight like a social network or event management. It only keeps track of your listening history and creates statistics from it. That's it. But this focus on its core does allow it to potentially implement much better database features. One example: Maloja supports multiple artists per track. So those poor artists who are always just mentioned as "featuring" in the track title can finally fight for a place in your personal charts.

### Why not use the established API?

Compatibility creates overhead effort. I only made this for myself, so I have no need to support lots of music players and scrobblers.

### Why Maloja?

I like to name my projects after regions in Grisons, Switzerland. Don't waste your time trying to find a connection, I just picked one at random. Do visit Maloja though. It's a great pass to drive.

## Current status

Deep in development. I just uploaded Maloja here in case I die tomorrow. It can accept scrobbles and return some basic stats in JSON format so far.
