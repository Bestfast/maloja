In this folder, you can save custom images for artists and tracks in case you
don't like the ones provided by Last.FM, you don't want to use Last.FM or it's
missing some artists / tracks that are important to you.

For artists, you can use a .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .gif image that is named like
the artist, but without whitespace and non-latin-alphabet characters (plus
extension). In case you want to have multiple images of the same format, you may
add any number from 0-9 to the name. If you need more images than that, create a
folder named like the artist and add any images inside. So, for example, if your
artist is "Dal★Shabet", all these files would be considered:

DalShabet.jpg
DalShabet4.png
DalShabet0.gif
DalShabet/bestimage.jpeg
DalShabet/serri_only.png

The following files would not be considered:

Dal Shabet.gif			(Whitespace)
Dal★Shabet.png			(non-latin character)
DalShabet.webm			(wrong extension)
DalShabet23.jpg			(to digit number)
DalShabet/SomeoneLikeU_MV.mp4	(wrong extension)
DalShabet3/party.png		(wrong folder name)



The same concept applies to tracks, however their name consists of all artists in
alphabetical order joined by a dash (-), then an underscore (_) and the track
title. Rules as above apply, so if your track was named "Epic Crossover 파티 협동"
and it was performed by HyunA, Dal★Shabet and Taylor Swift, the following files
would be considered:

DalShabet-HyunA-TaylorSwift_EpicCrossover.jpg
DalShabet-HyunA-TaylorSwift_EpicCrossover3.png
DalShabet-HyunA-TaylorSwift_EpicCrossover/albumcover.png
DalShabet-HyunA-TaylorSwift_EpicCrossover/dancing.gif

Not accepted would be:

DalShabet-HyunA-Taylor Swift_EpicCrossover.jpg			(Whitespace)
DalShabet-HyunA-TaylorSwift_EpicCrossover파티협동.jpg		(non-latin characters)
HyunA-DalShabet-TaylorSwift_EpicCrossover.jpg			(wrong artist order)
