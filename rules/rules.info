This folder can have any number of tsv files to group your rules

The first column defines the type of the rule:
	notanartist	Defines strings that can appear behind "feat" in a song title, but denote additional information about the track instead of another artist.
			Second column is the string
	belongtogether	Defines an artist with an ampersand in their name. Otherwise, amerpsands are interpreted as denoting two different artists (except when there are no spaces).
			Second column is the full name of the artist
	replacetitle	Defines an alternative spelling of a track title that should be replaced.
			Second column is the 'wrong' spelling
			Third column the correct spelling
	replaceartist	Defines and alternative spelling of an artist that should be replaced
			Second column is the 'wrong' spelling
			Third column the correct spelling. Use ␟ if the spelling should correct to a several artists
	countas		Defines an artist that should be counted together with another artist for chart statistics etc.
			This will not change the separation in the database and all effects of this rule will disappear as soon as it is no longer active.
			Second column is the artist
			Third column the replacement artist / grouping label

Rules in non-tsv files are ignored. '#' is used for comments.
